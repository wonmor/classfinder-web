## Hello, I'm John!

As of 2023/24 year, I am an incoming freshman at UC Irvine with an undeclared major. I will be primarily focusing on the studies of Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioinformatics.

When I was 15, I studied in Canada all by myself, while living with my aunt. It truly was an one of its kind experience — something in which not many people would try. Born in South Korea but spent majority of my teenage years in Canada, I managed to absorb both cultures: the North American and East Asian ways of living.

This really contributed in diversifying my knowledge and understanding in two widly distinct cultures, as well as traditions all around the world.

I led the development of the ClassFinder project during my summer vacation in Seoul, brainstorming new ideas and writing code, with a sprinkle of caffeine on top.

## Words from John's Dad.

I must say, I am very proud of some astonishing milestones that my son has reached in the past few months!

I have more than 30 years of experience in writing low-level hardware code, primarily in C++. I have also instructed many middle/high school students in various robotics competitions, here in South Korea.

In the next coming years, I will continue maintaining the code base of this project while John is away studying in America. I also handle the business side of things within this project — e.g. communicating with the users if they are experiencing any problems.
